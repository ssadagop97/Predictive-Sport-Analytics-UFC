**Module 1 Introduction and Problem Statement**

Mixed martial arts (MMA) is a full-contact combat sport that allows striking and grappling, both standing and, on the ground, using techniques from other combat sports and martial arts. Based in the United States, the UFC produces events worldwide that showcase twelve weight divisions and abide by the Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts. It has many real-life applications such as gambling, journalism and improvement of player performance by scrutinizing the advantages of the other opponents and refining his own performance in accordance with that data. Our Plan is to develop a comprehensive predictive model to predict the winners of UFC Fights from each fighters' statistics prior to the fight. We were intrigued by the highly unpredictable nature of the sport which drove us to analyze and look out for any patterns from the statistics of the fighters. We would be predicting the winner of a given brawl with the information of the two fighters and their prior records.
